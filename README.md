A desktop client for [Yume Nikki Online](https://ynoproject.net/) with Discord Rich Presence.  
Show your friends what game you're playing and what room you're in. Also looks pretty cool as an installed program.  
Created as a simple Electron wrapper around the website, with discord-rpc and some hacks to make save exporting/importing work.
